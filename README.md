# Offdex

**Offdex: Codex mobile app.**

Offdex is a public monorepo for a fast, polished, local-first Codex experience across phone and web.

## Current Stack

- `apps/mobile`: Expo + React Native
- `apps/web`: Next.js App Router
- Bun workspaces
- Turborepo task orchestration

## Priorities

- UX first
- performance first
- cross-platform by default
- native modules where they earn their keep
- no paywalls

## Run

```bash
bun install
bun run dev:web
bun run dev:mobile
```

## Repo Shape

```text
apps/
  mobile/   Expo client
  web/      Landing page now, broader web surface later
packages/   Shared protocol, bridge, relay, UI, native modules
```

## Status

This is the clean start. The old Remodex fork is no longer the product repo.
